This repository investigates the long-time phase ordering kinetics of the 3-state Potts model on rewired 2D square lattices following a zero-temperature quench. The lattice rewiring follows the Watts-Strogatz algorithm. This work was conducted as a high school research project in 2020 at the Petnica Science Center.
